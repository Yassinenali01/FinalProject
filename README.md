# FinalProject

We have developed a restaurant management system, with 3 screens namely Employees, Dishes and Events.

The employee screen displays the list of all the employees and it also has the functionality to add and delete the employees.

We have a dishes screen which inherits id and name fields from the restaurant class, and it displays all the available dishes on the menu. The user has the ability to add and delete the dishes.

We also have an events screen which interits id and name from restaurant class as well. This screen display all the events happening in the restaurant and the users can add or delete the events.
